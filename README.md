## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20 or later)
- `npm` or a compatible package manager

### 2. Environment Variables

To connect the application to your Firebase project, you need to set up environment variables.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
2.  Add your Firebase project configuration to it, like so:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run

```bash
# Install project dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
